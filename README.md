### Hi there 👨🏽‍💻

I work at [@weareangular](https://weareangular.com) from 🇨🇴, managing and building awesome solutions and user-centered tools.\
I like writing and learning code¹ to build useful and beautiful things.

¹ I write TypeScript, Javascript, ReactJS, React Redux & NextJS. But I'm actively learning GraphQL, SQL & Flutter.
